Flow
=====

Keep your flow while working

Why Flow
---------

I found that [Pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) breaks my flow when I'm successfully inmmerse in a certain task. 

[Some people suggest](http://productivity.stackexchange.com/a/813) changing the amount of intervals and try out things like 35/5, 50/10 or 45/10, But this hasn't proven to be effective for me either.

What is Flow, then?
--------------------

Flow is a miminalistic time-management tool that helps you maintaining a good balance among activity and rest. While you are working, you are earning time to rest later. If you start feeling tired, you can take a break and the time counts down. Flow gives you feeback on wether you are working too much, or resting more than enough.

What are the trade-offs
-----------------------

Flow is excellent if you want to be highly productive and in a flow state, while keep a good balance between activity and rest. However, this same flexibility makes Flow not so good as a planning technique, something Pomodoro is good at.

If you are a programmer or a designer, and like me, you perform better when deeply inmerse in what you are doing, then Flow is for you!
